Goal:=============================================================================

Our goal in this project is to build a Graph module in C that implements the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. We will use our Graph module to find the strongly connected components of a digraph.

Files:=============================================================================

Graph.c - Graph file containing the operations of Graph functions.

Graph.h - Graph file containing the forward declarations of functions.

FindComopnents.c - FindComponents file containing the main execution of functions from Graph.c

GraphTest.c - GraphTest file containing the testing of operations

List.c - List file containing the operations of List functions.

List.h - List file containing the forward declarations of functions.

Makefile - File used to automate build process.
